### Overview
This repository is what powers the [build experience](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/video-search-and-summarization), showcasing video search and summarization agent with NVIDIA NIM microservices.

Insightful, accurate, and interactive video analytics AI agents enable a range of industries to make better decisions faster. These AI agents are given tasks through natural language and can perform complex operations like video summarization and visual question-answering, unlocking entirely new application possibilities. The NVIDIA AI Blueprint makes it easy to get started building and customizing video analytics AI agents for video search and summarization — all powered by generative AI, vision language models (VLMs) like Cosmos Nemotron VLMs, large language models (LLMs) like Llama Nemotron LLMs, NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, and NVIDIA NIM.

1. **NIM microservices**: Here are models used in this blueprint:

    - [cosmos-nemotron-34b](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/cosmos-nemotron-34b)
    - [meta / llama-3.1-70b-instruct](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama-3_1-70b-instruct)
    - [llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2)
    - [llama-3_2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2)

2. **Ingestion Pipeline**: 

    The process involves decoding video segments (chunks) generated by the stream handler, selecting frames, and using a vision-language model (VLM) along with a caption prompt to generate detailed captions for each chunk. These dense captions are then indexed into vector and graph databases for use in the Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow.

3. **Context Manager**: 

    Efficiently incorporates tools — a vision-language model (VLM) and a large language model (LLM), using them as required. Key functions including a summary generator, an answer generator, and an alert handler. The tools and functions are used in summary generation, handling Q&A, and managing alerts. In addition, context manager effectively maintains its working context by making efficient use of both short-term memory, such as chat history, and long-term memory resources like vector and graph databases, as needed.

4. **CA-RAG module**:

    The Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CA-RAG) module leverages both Vector RAG and Graph-RAG as the primary sources for video understanding. During the Q&A workflow, the CA-RAG module extracts relevant context from the vector database and graph database to enhance temporal reasoning, anomaly detection, multi-hop reasoning, and scalability, thereby offering deeper contextual understanding and efficient management of extensive video data.

### Prerequisites

#### NVAIE developer license

#### Obtain API Keys

1. Apply for [Early Access Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/ai-blueprint-for-video-search-and-summarization-early-access/join)  for Video Search And Summarization NVIDIA AI Blueprint.
2. Login to [NGC Portal](https://ngc.nvidia.com/) with the same account you applied for early access.
3. Follow the [steps here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-user-guide/index.html#generating-personal-api-key) to obtain an NGC API Key.

This API Key (```NVIDIA_API_KEY```) will be used to pull the blueprint container and other models that will be used as part of the blueprint.

### Known CVEs
|   CVE    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [CVE-2024-11393](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wrfc-pvp9-mr9g) | This impacts the transformers v4.47.0 python package. This impacts the Hugging Face Transformers MaskFormer Model Deserialization and allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. However, this does not affect VSS since MaskFormer model is not used in VSS. |

This impacts the Hugging Face Transformers MobileViTV2 Model Deserialization and allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. However, this does not affect VSS since MobileViTV2 model is not used in VSS. |
| [CVE-2024-11394](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hxxf-235m-72v3) | This impacts the transformers v4.47.0 python package.
