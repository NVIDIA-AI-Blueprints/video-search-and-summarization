    "#### Q&A with VSS\n",
    "\n",
    "VSS supports Question-Answering (Q&A) functionality via **Vector-RAG** and **Graph-RAG**. Vector-RAG is the only supported method for live stream processing. And Graph-RAG is specifically designed for video-based queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q&A with Vector-RAG:** Captions generated by the VLM, along with their embeddings, are stored in Milvus DB. Given a query, the top five most relevant chunks are retrieved, re-ranked using ```llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2```, and passed to a LLM to generate the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q&A with Graph-RAG:** To capture the complex information produced by the VLM, a knowledge graph is built and stored during video ingestion. Use an LLM to convert the dense captions in a set of nodes, edges, and associated properties. This knowledge graph is stored in a graph database. Captions and embeddings, generated with ```llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2```, are also linked to these entities. By using Graph-RAG techniques, an LLM can access this information to extract key insights for Q&A.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can find the full set of [example notebooks](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/resources/vlm-lita-getting-started-ea/files) for Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) usecase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-1. Data Preparation for SOP Use Case: `01_Data_Labeling.ipynb`**\n",
    "- Video chunking (frame/window segmentation)\n",

    "- Supports: MCQ (Multiple Choice QA), GQA (General QA), and BQA (Binary QA)\n",
