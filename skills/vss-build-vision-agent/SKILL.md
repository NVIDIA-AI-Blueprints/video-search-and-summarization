description: Compose VSS-based agent deployments from a natural-language capability description. Use this skill when the user asks for a new VSS profile or extension to an existing profile. Route, compose, configure, and deploy stock base, alerts, LVS, or search developer profiles and lean custom combinations expressed as delta overlays using one current developer profile as the Foundation.

## Routing

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| Deploy, start, run, verify, or stop a named `base`, `alerts`, `lvs`, or `search` profile | Stock mode for that profile. |
| Deploy capabilities that exactly match one current developer profile | Stock mode for the exact match. |
| Build, create, extend, customize, combine, add, or remove capabilities | Delta mode using the closest current developer profile as the Foundation. |
| A named profile qualified as headless | Delta mode off that profile, not a stock deploy. |
| Deploy capabilities with no exact match | Build the smallest delta, then deploy it. |
| Resolution leaves a blocker the rules cannot settle (unmapped or ambiguous capability, Foundation tie, singleton conflict, or requested/excluded contradiction) | Clarification gate (`references/composition.md`): after one deterministic pass, ask one structured question, then resolve on the answer. Never re-run the same resolution or guess past the blocker. |
| Warehouse or another industry profile | Stop: this skill currently covers developer examples only. |

## Steps

1. Parse the request and any eval specification into required capabilities, excluded capabilities, configuration knobs, and observable success checks.
2. Read the matching file under `references/profiles/` and `references/sizing.md`. In delta mode, compare all four current profiles and select exactly one Foundation; an equally-small-delta tie between two profiles is a clarification-gate blocker (step 5), not a guess. Read `references/edge.md` for DGX Spark or Thor.
3. Before resolution or deployment, run the applicable checks from `references/prerequisites.md`, `references/credentials.md`, and `references/ngc.md`. Read the environment and Brev references when applicable.
4. Read `references/composition.md` and only the capability-owner files under `references/services/` needed by the request.
5. Determine the effective service set. For an exact stock match, keep its authoritative set unchanged. Otherwise compute the smallest delta from the Foundation’s exact `COMPOSE_PROFILES`: add or remove only canonical service profile keys and change only requested environment knobs. If this single pass leaves a blocker the rules cannot settle (an unmapped or ambiguous capability, a Foundation tie, a singleton conflict, or a requested/excluded contradiction), apply the clarification gate in `references/composition.md`: ask one structured question, then resolve on the answer; never re-run the same resolution or guess past the blocker.
6. Before writing delta artifacts or starting a stock or delta deployment, present a compact architecture diagram in the conversation. Show the Foundation, added and removed capability owners and service keys, principal data flows and topics, external endpoints, and GPU/model placement. Do not save the diagram as a build artifact.
7. For every stock or delta build, write `_builds/<name>/override.env`, `_builds/<name>/compose.yml`, and `_builds/<name>/resolved.yml`. Put the Foundation, the full effective `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, required build-local path/host values, and only environment values that are customized or transitively derived from a customization in `override.env`; do not copy unchanged Foundation defaults such as stock ports or model knobs. Make `compose.yml` include the root `deploy/docker/compose.yml` plus only minimal changed or new service Compose files, if any. Treat `<name>` only as a filesystem label; never add it to `COMPOSE_PROFILES`.
8. Generate `resolved.yml` with `docker compose config` using the ordered env layers in `references/composition.md`, normalize dangling optional dependencies with `scripts/normalize_resolved_yml.py`, then run the mandatory check/create gate in `references/data-directory.md`. Reject stale placeholders and invalid checked-in bind sources with `scripts/validate_resolved_yml.py`; if validation finds real unresolved `${...}` Compose interpolation, add only the missing concrete values to `override.env` and regenerate before proceeding. Do not count escaped container-shell variables such as `$${HOST_IP}` as unresolved Compose interpolation. Validate the selected keys, services, images, required peers, GPU placement, utilization, and requested success checks against that exact file.
9. If deployment was requested, deploy the exact `_builds/<name>/resolved.yml` validated in the previous step, refresh its registry images even when their tags already exist locally, use `references/readiness.md` with the matching profile checks, and follow `references/deployment.md` for the resolved-Compose lifecycle. When a source must be provisioned into the deployed build (a headless build registers none at bring-up), follow `references/stream-provisioning.md`: register one VIOS source and fan out to only the consumers the build resolved (RT-CV/RT-Embed/RT-VLM) by direct REST, with consumer ports resolved from `resolved.yml` and each consumer driven from the retried VIOS live-proxy URL. When a search query round-trip is then requested against the deployed build, follow `references/query.md`: resolve the CLI endpoints and indexes from the build's `resolved.yml` and run the read-path query it defines (retrieval-only; the concrete command, decomposition, and query mechanics live in `query.md` and `vss-search-archive`). For stop or cleanup, follow `references/teardown.md`: remove project volumes by default and preserve model caches only when the user explicitly requests it.
