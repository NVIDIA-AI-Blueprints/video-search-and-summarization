## Description: <br>
Use this skill when answering a question about previously analyzed or freshly scoped VSS video, or when reading a stored VSS memory job or record by id, or whenever a question should be answered by running the `vss memory introspect` command. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to answer questions about previously analyzed or freshly scoped video from a deployed NVIDIA VSS stack, including reading stored memory jobs, running visual introspection queries, and performing direct VLM inspection. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Optional] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
17 evaluation tasks (16 positive, 1 negative) across 2 agents in isolated sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Whether the expected skill was selected and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
