## Description: <br>
Generates VSS video summary reports with LVS HITL and optional Enterprise RAG document grounding. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to generate video summary reports with Enterprise RAG document grounding and guided human-in-the-loop parameter collection using the VSS LVS profile. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
3 evaluation tasks (2 positive, 1 negative) from skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot, each run in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 76.0% | 70.1% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 pts) | 100.0% → 83.3% (-16.7 pts) |
| Correctness | 20.0% → 80.0% (+60.0 pts) | 46.7% → 73.3% (+26.6 pts) |
| Discoverability | 50.0% | 47.5% |
| Effectiveness | 28.1% → 51.7% (+23.6 pts) | 42.9% → 47.6% (+4.7 pts) |
| Efficiency | 98.4% | 98.6% |
